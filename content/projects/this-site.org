This site is served by [[https://pages.github.com/][Github Pages]], and the corresponding [[https://github.com/mclehman/mclehman.github.io][repository]] always reflects the currently deployed version of the site, give or take some caching delays.

The development version of this site is available [[https://github.com/mclehman/hugo-maxfieldlehman.com][here]]. Once I actually nail down a workflow and the entire site is no longer one big experiment, the master branch on the dev repo should also reflect the curently live site. For the time being, I do not have any sort of continuous delivery pipeline set up.

A full write-up is on the way, detailing the theme in use (and modifications to it) as well as the backend generation setup.
