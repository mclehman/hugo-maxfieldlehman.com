I shopped around a little before deciding to use [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]] as the generator for my site. I'd been meaning to give [[https://www.getgutenberg.io/][Gutenberg]] a chance for a while, and [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]] appeals to the part of my brain that likes taking painfully abstract math courses, but in the end I decided to go for something a bit more established and popular.

One of the perks of Hugo is [[https://orgmode.org][Org mode]] support as a drop in replacement for Markdown. I'm in the early stages of recovery from emacs-is-my-OSis, but I still use it for general editing, initial drafts of Latex documents, and as my preferred Git porcelain. As such, Org is much more my speed.

Currently, I'm using the [[https://github.com/hivickylai/hugo-theme-sam][Sam]] Hugo theme. I wanted something simple, and I'd say this just about nails that. The site's layout did confuse someone right off the bat, though, so I'll have to be watching out for any usability issues. I've got to keep in mind that because 90% of my friends are also developers I can be blind to how most people are going to see the things I make.

So far, the only part of the theme I've really customized is typography. Body text is [[https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat][Montserrat]], title text is [[https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Averia+Serif+Libre][Averia Serif Libre]]. Dan Sayers, whose site appears to be down, created the original Averia font through an averaging of all the fonts on his system, and the Averia Libre fonts do the same with fonts from Google Fonts. I really like the way they look, so I threw out the fonts I'd been leaning toward before and started over looking for a body font. I also moved link underlines up and behind descenders in the link text, which I feel has a cleaner look.

Plans going forward:

- Actually write up the various project descriptions.

- Explain the names some of my projects have been saddled with.

- Revisit the resume "section". Blind-linking to a pdf isn't nice, and I know that.

- Add an "about me" section unless the reworked resume section fills that niche.

- See about adding [[https://perl6.org][Perl 6]] support to [[http://pygments.org/][Pygments]] since I'll inevitably throw some P6 up on here.
