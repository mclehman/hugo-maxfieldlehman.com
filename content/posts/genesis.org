At a truly inopportune time, I've decided to finally get this site going again.

# more

I'm already spending too much time tinkering with personal projects instead of class assignments, but at least with this I'll have something I made to point to.

This site used to be up as a sort of mini-resume, but I let it slide into obselesence and killed it rather than leave an inaccurate site up without the time or motivation to maintain it.

At this point, I'm not sure what this site will be, but I'm committed to keeping it updated going forward.
