Raleway is in.

# more

Somehow, I managed to find and use a font /without/ ligatures without noticing for a while. Eventually, the tiny gaps and overlaps got to me and I came to my senses.

When I made sure to take ligatures into account, I found out that Raleway's solid support for them (especially ff, ffi, ffl) is more than enough to outweigh my distaste for the crossing W. I had some reservations about using it as a body font, but after lowering the weight slightly, I'm happy with the end result.
